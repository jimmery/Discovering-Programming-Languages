/* 
   Going back and forth is the basis of Prolog. 

   This is difficult, when we get into the realm of MATH. 
   Primality testing is actually polynomial time. 
   Factoring is hard (while multiplication is easy). 

   Arithmetic: 
   not reversible in general
   - solving Diophantine equations is undecidable. 
      poly(x1,...,xn) = 0

   - solvable but intractable: 
      - factoring large numbers. 

   - solvable efficiently
      - solving linear inequalities.
